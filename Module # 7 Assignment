#In your blog, discuss the following questions:
  
  #How do you tell what OO system (S3 vs. S4) an object is associated with?
  #S3 are from the beginning
  #S4 are developed later, and they always have a second step class association that 
  # has to be done before the object can be a s4
  
  
  #How do you determine the base type (like integer or list) of an object?
  #You apply the specific function to the base type to process the object
  #orientation. 
  
  
  
  #What is a generic function?
  #It's a function which dispatches methods. Typially
  #an encapsulated a "genaric" concept, such as plot, 
  #mean, logLik, residuals, predicts, summary. 
  
  
  #What are the main differences between S3 and S4?
  # S3 is simpler, you have the easy access of creating an object
  # that with S4 you have to create an additional class before
