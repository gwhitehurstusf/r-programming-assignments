#explanation
#The result of the error message from testing the R code above, is seen below in the output console. The error message reads, 

#"Error in myMean(assignment2) : object 'assignment' not found"

#The function fails because in R Programming you have to address the code properly in order for the program to successfully work. 
#In the above code, applying myMean to assignment2 is invalid, due to having myMean already written attributing the function variable with assignment2. 
#The error message reads that the object 'assignment' is not found. The proper wording in this code needs to be 'assignment2' for everything. In that case, the coding works properly.
