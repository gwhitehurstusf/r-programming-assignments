  'x' must be a square matrix


The procedure that I took was simple, following the led instructions at the bottom of the activity. I then looked into the det() function, which is the determinant of the matrix. 
This allowed me to understand that the determinant of the matrix of A is 0, and the determinant of the matrix of B is not applicable, meaning there it is not a square matrix. 
The coding above shows the errors from R Studio of the determinant.
